    <h2>Thought</h2>
    <p>
      While studying at University of Arizona in Tucson, I became captivated by
      philosophy—specifically questions and problems in philosophy of mind, such
      as "How does consciousness arise from purely physical processes?" and in
      metaphysics, such as "What accounts for the intelligibility of the world?"
      I quickly learned that only very specific kinds of people were interested
      in these kinds of questions. Alas, here I am. After some time, I began to
      see that a spiritual perspective on reality was the only way to get
      satisfying answers to these kinds of questions. After quite a bit more
      digging, I landed firmly in the Christian faith. I've come to enjoy using
      these different perspectives—both philosophical and theological—to think
      about the world, culture, and life within them.

    <h2>Action</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Running is my favorite form of exercise. I enjoy the challenge of
        hurling myself into difficult situations and testing my ability to
        maintain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reading is my favorite form of productive relaxation. I am fascinated by
        the written word's ability to contain and convey such complex and
        profound forms of knowledge and wisdom. Of course, that's dependent on
        the mind behind them.

        I'm something of a music junkie. I love both contemporary and classical
        music. A guy named
        <a
          href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0Dg1KwgmtUzeMQonDCUFhQ?si=D2-jyEF1QlyhP123rKQr_g"
          target="_blank"
          >Jon Hopkins</a
        >
        is my favorite on the contemporary side—at least for the moment.
        <a
          href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6wJoLjgfqx2hEYwZ1p6jrY"
          target="_blank"
          >Bach</a
        >, more securely, is my favorite on the classical side.

        I enjoy the creative and intuitive process of building things. As a
        fledgling web developer, I am coming to see web development as a
        wonderful medium for this.
